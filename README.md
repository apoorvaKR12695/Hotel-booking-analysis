 Now, I download the dataset to use as a pandas dataframe.
Checking whether there is duplicates values or not
And dropping the duplicates values

After dropping the duplicates values, country columns have the null values so we drop the null values  in order to get a better result.

The purpose of this study is  to provide new insights into the factors that influence cancellation behavior. at the stage of exploratory data analysis (EDA),  managed to notice interesting relationships between the features of the reservation and the indicator of its cancellation

# 5.EDA

Analysis of given data set in following ways:
 
 1.Hotel wise analysis
 
2.Distribution channel wise analysis

3.Booking cancellation analysis
