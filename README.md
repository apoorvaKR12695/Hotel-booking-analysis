<p>The data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has from the data.
We will perform exploratory data analysis with python to get insight from the data..</p>

<h2> :book: Exploratory Data Analysis </h2>

<p>Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.

EDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and provides a provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them. It can also help determine if the statistical techniques you are considering for data analysis are appropriate. Originally developed by American mathematician John Tukey in the 1970s, EDA techniques continue to be a widely used method in the data discovery process today.

<h2> :book: Analysis </h2>

<p> Replacing With Mean/Median/Mode,deleting rows, using KNN classifier or Assigning unique values.
Analysis of given data set in following ways:
 
 1.Hotel wise analysis
 
 2.Distribution channel wise analysis

3.Booking cancellation analysis

4.Time wise analysis

<h2> :clipboard: Execution Instruction</h2>
<p>The order of execution of the program files is as follows:</p>


<p><b>1) final_notebook_Hotel_Booking_Analysis_Apoorva_KR.ipynb</b></p>
<p> This file must be executed, to define all the functions and variables required to do Exploratory data Analysis and gain the insights from it to decide on which factors the booking demand is high
